# Linking Results of Power System Expansion Optimizations to Differences in Meteorological Inputs
## Resources, outputs and findings from group 5 of the 2021 Energy-Climate Hackathon

### Introduction
The weather-driven availability of the variable renewable resources (VRES) is one of the key inputs to numerical power system expansion models. Commonly, this information is derived from a meteoroligical data set, which covers a relatively short time period compared to the variability time scales of weather and climate. Hence, the variability of the availability of the VRES is only partially captured by the power system models. tbc ...

### About this Repository
During the 2021 Energy-Climate Hackathon a few first steps to investigate the differences in the meteorological input data sets as well as in the results of the power system optimizations using these data sets have been conducted. This repository includes the python scripts and notebooks created for this purpose. Note that the raw data, and `pickle` files generated from the raw data, that were ued in the analyses have not been included in this repository because they are very large in data size and we do not want to make the repository very slow to load. Therefore the data directory as-is only contains some CSV files generated from the raw data.
