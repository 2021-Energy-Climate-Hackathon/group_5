# group_5

## Getting Started
- Our group folder is /gws/pw/j05/cop26_hackathons/oxford/Group_folders/group_5/
- A python virtuel invironment was installed here: /gws/smf/j04/cop26_hackathons/oxford/group_5/shared_pyenvs/ (activate via conda activate <path to environment>, recommendation: create a symbolic link to your home folder)
- Data is stored in /gws/pw/j05/cop26_hackathons/oxford/Group_folders/group_5/data/
- There is a group github repository. Please send your github user name to Bruno (will invite you to the team, then).
  
## First Steps
- Investigate differences in meteorological input data in power systems simulations stored in the data folder (more simulation will be added throughout the week).
- Investigate differences in results of power systems simulations stored in the data folder (more simulation will be added throughout the week).
- Link differences in results to differences in input data
- Transform further met data to energy data (using the atlite package).

## About the data stored here
- Note that the raw data, and `pickle` files generated from the raw data, that
  were ued in the analyses have not been included in this repository because
  they are very large in data size and we do not want to make the repository
  very slow to load. Therefore the data directory as-is only contains some CSV
  files generated from the raw data.
