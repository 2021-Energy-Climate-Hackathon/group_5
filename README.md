# group_5

## Getting Started
- Our group folder is /gws/pw/j05/cop26_hackathons/oxford/Group_folders/group_5/
- A python virtuel invironment was installed here: /gws/smf/j04/cop26_hackathons/oxford/group_5/shared_pyenvs/ (activate via conda activate <path to environment>, recommendation: create a symbolic link to your home folder)
- Data is stored in /gws/pw/j05/cop26_hackathons/oxford/Group_folders/group_5/data/
- There is a group github repository. Please send your github user name to Bruno (will invite you to the team, then).
  
## First Steps
- Investigate differences in meteorological input data in power systems simulations stored in the data folder (more simulation will be added throughout the week).
- Investigate differences in results of power systems simulations stored in the data folder (more simulation will be added throughout the week).
- Link differences in results to differences in input data
- Transform further met data to energy data (using the atlite package).
